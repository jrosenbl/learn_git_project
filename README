this is my first Git project.  I will use it to learn a little bit about git.  
A git bit is what I will learn by using this project.

so far I've learned about the following commands

git config
git config --list
git add
git status
git diff
git diff --cache
git commit
git commit -m "update description"
git commit -a  # commit all tracked files

git remote # list remote servers (short names only)
git remote -v # verbose list remote repositories (show urls)
git remote add <short name> <url> 

git clone <url> # create local master
git fetch # retrieve remote project but don't merge
git pull  # retrieve branch and merge
